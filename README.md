# Bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

This simple program will recieve any book in a .txt format, and return the total number of words and individual characters present in the book.

Please see [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) to access books for this project.
